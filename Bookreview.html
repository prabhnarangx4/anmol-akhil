   <img src="hh.jpeg" width="300" height="300"><p><h4>After a long time, I have chanced upon a book belonging to the modern-day mythological thriller genre.<br>As far as I recall, it’s been quite a while since I last read a blend of mythological fiction, adventure thriller, and sci-fi.<br>And with my expectations set quite high, I sat down for a roller coaster of a ride and started reading Akshat Gupta’s The Hidden Hindu.<br> Read on to know more about the book and my experience of reading it.</h4></p>&ensp;<br> <img src="gm.jpeg" width="300" height="300"><p><h4>The Greek Myths (1955) is a mythography, a compendium of Greek mythology, with comments and analyses,<br>by the poet and writer Robert Graves, normally published in two volumes, though there are abridged editions that present the myths only.<br>Each myth is presented in the voice of a narrator writing under the Antonines, such as Plutarch or Pausanias, with citations of the classical sources.<br>The literary quality of these retelling's is generally praised.

   </h4></p>&ensp;<br> <img src="HM.jpeg" width="300" height="300"><p><h4>One of the most interesting parts of this book was the outlined Creation myths, the Cosmic Egg and the four great yugas, cycles of growth and destruction.<br>

      The narration by Oliver Hunt was eloquent, clearly read at a speed which allowed for the information to be absorbed. <br>He also effortlessly pronounced the sometimes challenging names. His is a pleasant, well modulated English accented voice that made <br>an excellent foil for the text.
      
      With such an enormous subject to cover, including, as the author admits, contradictory texts since the stories are drawn from <br>vast regions of place and time, this small volume acts as a good introduction.</h4></p>&ensp;<br><img src="i.jpeg" width="300" height="300"><p><h4>The Greek Mythology handbook is really detailed and organized with lots of interesting facts. We learn about each of the different gods, goddesses, and more.<br>There's a lot of information but the author links them together and tells us the individual stories.<br>It explains what each god/goddess is famous for and their backstory. The layout is easy to follow along with and the illustrations are gorgeous.<br>I would definitely buy this to have for my personal book collection once it comes out. There are even recommendations of movies and books in Greek mythology towards the end.</h4></p>&ensp; <br><img src="as.webp" width="300" height="300"><p><h4>This large book contains a detailed description and explanation of the mythologies of practically all regions of Asia with scholars like J. Hackin, Clement Huart,<br> Raymonde Linossier, H. de Wilman Grabowska, Charles-Henri Marchal, Henri Maspero and Serge Eliseev.

The mythologies that are discussed are that of Persia (Parsi mythology), Kafirs (a non muslim sect of Afghanistan),<br> Buddhism in India, Brahmanic Mythology, Lamaism, Mythology of Indo-China and Java, Mythology of modern China and the mythology of Japan. <br>The book has 15 plates and 354 other illustration in the text.
